All of its victims have disappeared without trace, we can only assume fully consumed by the wraith.

"This still does not explain the malice for other races, other than a simplistic fear of those who are different. The most plausible explanation would be that non-humans were born from the lesser tribes of the time which the ancient humans warred with.

"It's no secret that I do not regard the Okranite religion of any value to historical research. But for the sake of theorisation, let's assume that the beginnings of Okranism do coincide with the mass extinction - the First Extinction, as they themselves call it. \n"
"\n"
"Scapegoating can be frighteningly easy during times of turmoil, and mixed with religious fanaticism it can be all the more cruel. Let's take Atticus' biological extinction as the reason for the ancient's end. The skeleton, immune to disease and biological attack, would have been the strongest surviving race and perhaps even a subject of envy. The first religious texts originate back to a considerably longer time after the age of the oldest ruins, which suggests a chain of lost misinterpretations combined with this scapegoating. \n"
"\n"
"Now let's look at another tragedy of nature: Volcanic eruption, earthquake, flooding... Be it self inflicted destructive force or natural disaster, such huge scale destruction could easily be interpreted as an act of the 'demon'. The skeletons survived the atrocity, perhaps due to a sturdier physical makeup, and thus are associated with this 'demon' as the ones to have carried out her will.\n"

Prehistoric and undeveloped tribes existing in a land of such advanced science is clearly backward - are the inhabitants of the Cannibal Plains devolving? \n"

"Without knowing whether there was an overlap in the existence of the two civilisations, we could assume that the cannibals are in fact direct descendents of the ancient inhabitants. Their degeneration could be put down to toxic environmental factors which they were unable to adapt to; damaging substances from their very own labs; induced madness from experiments gone wrong; or simply being reduced to cannibalism due to severe famine. \n"

A perfect instance of survival of the fittest. Some of the weaponry and internal damages found within the labs indicate an alternate possibility of internal civil war, although the damage could be the result of simple cannibal quarrels after their occupation. The cannibals have a savage nature and are known to frequently fight amongst themselves and feed on one another, particularly given the severe lack of victims outside their tribes since the area is mainly avoided by most rational thinking individuals.\n"

"Comparing the two eras, X were considerably more advanced and established than Y, with a markedly larger network and more advanced industry. The unnatural scattering of constructions indicates a highly destructive (man-made or natural) disaster as a possible reason for downfall. The significant change in 'elaborateness' of ruins shows a heavy divide within castes. \n"
"\n"
"Y, on the other hand, seems to share some of the same technologies but shows to be a far more ramshackle and inferior version of X. Civilisation X was far more long lived than Y, perhaps Y came into being as a more inferior imitation of X frantically trying to rebuild their lost empire. \n"
"\n"
"Theorist Sabina maintains that the surviving skeleton race we see today lived as the dominant inhabitants of X, however this does not explain why the skeletons would not have been able to rebuild their civilisation, based on their advanced knowledge. Either way, based on the tech found in the labs of civilisation X, skeletons definitely existed within this culture. Whether they were merely a creation of X or the sole inhabitants of X we still do not know. Only further surveying will tell.\n"

But how did skeletons survive the mass extinction? And why do they have no memory of the ancient ages despite their ancient life span? \n"

"Most likely the memory loss is down to simple stability breakdown due to old age, but here we have multiple explanations for the skeleton survival: 1) The safe incubation of new skeletons 'being born' during the event 2) Fleeing to safety during the turmoil while their masters perished 3) The masters succumbed to biologically destructive means while the skeletons were unaffected.\n"
